[Tao Yan](https://taoyan.netlify.com/) is a PhD student of Crop Genetics and Breeding at the Zhejiang University Crop Science Lab. My Ph.D research work covers a range of issues : Population Genetics Evolution and Ecotype Divergence Analysis of oilseed Rape, Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) of Agronomic Traits. Currently, He is interested in Transposable Elements Insertion Polymorphisms (TIPs) in Crop Population and genetic basis such as SV, CNV and TIPs etc shapes the diversity of different morphotypes of *B.napus*.
