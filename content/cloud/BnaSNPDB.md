## BnaSNPDB: SNP Database of *Brassica napus* L. 


{{<figure src="/img/BnaSNPDB.png">}}

## Overview

The SNP database of *Brassica napus* L. (**BnaSNPDB**) is an interactive web portal that provides multiple analysis modules to visualize and explore SNPs among 1007 rapeseed germplasm accessions based on the data reported by previous research ([Wu et al., 2019](http://rapeseed.zju.edu.cn/pdf/mp.pdf)). The app is deployed at [http://121.41.229.126:3838/bnasnpdb](http://121.41.229.126:3838/bnasnpdb) and http://rapeseed.zju.edu.cn:3838/bnasnpdb for online use. The whole dataset and code of BnaSNPDB is available at https://github.com/YTLogos/BnaSNPDB. 


**BnaSNPDB** is idle until you activate it. So it may take some time to load for the first time. Once it was activated, **BnaSNPDB** could be used smoothly and easily.

The portal is built entirely in **R** and **Shiny** using the **RStudio** development environment.
