{{<figure src="/img/snp_distribution.png" width="1000" hegiht="1200" align=center >}}


This app is developed to extract SNPs from our lab's 1000 *Brassica napus* database and visualize the distribution of SNPs in different groups(no more than 5 groups), you just need to upload your sample file, select the chromosome and enter genome region (start, end) you want to extract and visualize! An example of the expected input sample file format is present as below:

|   |   |
| -- | -- |
|R4157|Spring|
|R4158|Winter|
|R4163|Semi_winter|
|...|...|
