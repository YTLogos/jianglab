abstract = "Fatty acids (FAs) and FA-derived complex lipids play important roles in plant growth and vegetative development and are a class of prominent metabolites stored in mature seeds. The factors and regulatory networks that control FA accumulation in plant seeds remain largely unknown. The role of *TRANSPARENT TESTA8 (TT8)* in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis and the formation of seed coat color is extensively studied; however, its function in affecting seed FA biosynthesis is poorly understood. In this article, we show that Arabidopsis (*Arabidopsis thaliana*) *TT8* acts maternally to affect seed FA biosynthesis and inhibits seed FA accumulation by down-regulating a group of genes either critical to embryonic development or important in the FA biosynthesis pathway. Moreover, the *tt8* mutation resulted in reduced deposition of protein in seeds during maturation. Posttranslational activation of a TT8-GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TT8 represses the activities of *LEAFY COTYLEDON1, LEAFY COTYLEDON2, and FUSCA3*, the critical transcriptional factors important for seed development, as well as *CYTIDINEDIPHOSPHATE DIACYLGLYCEROL SYNTHASE2*, which mediates glycerolipid biosynthesis. These results help us to understand the entire function of *TT8* and increase our knowledge of the complicated networks regulating the formation of FA-derived complex lipids in plant seeds."
