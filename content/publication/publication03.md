abstract = "Global warming causes a faster increase of night temperature than of day temperature in tropical and subtropical zones. Little is known about the effect of high night temperature on storage lipids and transcriptome changes in oilseed rape. This study compared the total fatty acids and fatty acid compositions in seeds of two oilseed rape cultivars between high and low night temperatures. Their transcriptome profiles were also analyzed. High night temperature significantly affected the total fatty acids and fatty acid compositions in seeds of both low and high oil content cultivars, namely Jiuer-13 and Zheyou-50, thereby resulting in 18.9% and 13.7% total fatty acid reductions, respectively. In particular, high night temperature decreased the relative proportions of C18:0 and C18:1 but increased the proportions of C18:2 and C18:3 in both cultivars. In-depth analysis of transcriptome profiles revealed that high night temperature up-regulated gibberellin signaling during the night-time. This up-regulation was associated with the active expression of genes involved in fatty acid catabolism, such as those in β-oxidation and glyoxylate metabolism pathways. Although the effect of temperature on plant lipids has been previously examined, the present study is the first to focus on night temperature and its effect on the fatty acid composition in seeds."
